# This script trains a teacher model on CIFAR-10 using ResNet-50 architecture.
# It uses SGD optimizer with momentum and a step learning rate scheduler.
# The model is saved after training.
# The training process includes loss calculation and accuracy tracking.
# The script is designed to be run as a standalone program.
# It uses PyTorch for model training and data loading.
# The CIFAR-10 dataset is used for training and testing.
# The script is modular and can be easily modified for different datasets or models.
# The training loop includes model evaluation and learning rate adjustment.
